# TGS Salt Challenge
My solution for the [TGS Salt Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/tgs-salt-identification-challenge/overview) 
on Kaggle - **top 20%**

This challenge aims to build a model that can detect large salt deposits from image of seismic scans. Detecting salt 
is important beacause in most cases large accumulation of oil and gas are also found underneith these salt beds. 
Salt is also much easier to detech that oil and gas and so if a model can be trained to detect these salt beds 
it will be very profitable for the Oil and Gas companies because it makes oil discovery faster.
